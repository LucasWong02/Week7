\f0\fs24 \cf0 Imagine we have millions of inputs to Fine-tune a AI that\'92s going to help lawyers evaluate if a case is worth it or not. The inputs will be cases that are classified. The problem is that there is too much information and it is too heavy. A solution can be to embed all this information and then classify it by using Clustering. Lots of examples like this have been applied to Fine-tune OpenAI algorithms.}
